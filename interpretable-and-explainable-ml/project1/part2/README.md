# README

This code is for a binary image classification problem using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The goal is to classify images into two classes - 0 or 1.
The file is a `.ipynb` notebook with precomputed outputs.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\
The files containing the weights of the CNN are already present, make sure to specify the access path:

- `simple_CNN.pt` for the weights of the normal CNN. Download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bzG0ldknlTcFzpOaoticW5-GWZLp8Tud/view?usp=sharing

- `simple_CNN_rd.pt` for the version trained on the permuted training set. Download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K0KfYuhRgpDKHz3BC-1rMD3fmJqHMHfj/view?usp=sharing

If you want to rerun the code, you will need to download the dataset and adapt the paths.
